SUMMARY:
The Movie Rental Analysis Capstone Project navigates through the Sakila DVD Rental Store Database to extract invaluable insights pivotal for bolstering the rental store's overall performance. Through meticulous Data Acquisition, Transformation, and Cleaning processes, the project ensured the integrity and relevance of the datasets. Employing a MECE breakdown strategy facilitated a logical and structured progression, while leveraging SQL scripts and Power BI tools enabled seamless data manipulation and visualization.

Furthermore, the project delved into Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), utilizing SQL queries to address specific problem statements surrounding customer behavior, film inventory, staff performance, and store operations. Excel served as a robust tool for generating informative visualizations, shedding light on the outcomes of the SQL analysis. Dynamic Power BI dashboards were crafted to provide interactive insights, covering areas such as location, rental, film revenue, customer segmentation, and actor analysis. These dashboards, along with a comprehensive report and documentation, aim to empower rental store owners with actionable recommendations, fostering data-driven decision-making for sustained success in the competitive DVD rental market.
